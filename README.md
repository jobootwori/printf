# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
_Projects done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **African Leadership University School**. The aim of the projects is to learn about `pointers, arrays and strings` in `C language.`_


```sh
#Trying Bash duh!
```

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110`
- C files are written according to the `C90` standard
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Uses [betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding style
